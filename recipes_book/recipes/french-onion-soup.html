        <h1>French Onion Soup</h1>
        <h5>French Onion Soup is a classic French dish made with
             caramelized onions and beef stock or broth.</h5>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>3 onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red wine</li>
            <li>2 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed beef broth</li>
            <li>1 French baguette</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced Swiss cheese</li>
        </ul>    
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Melt butter in a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat.
                 Add onions and sugar; cook, stirring occasionally,
                  until onions are golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir in flour until well blended with onions and pan
                 juices. Add water, wine, and beef broth. Bring to a boil,
                  then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 10
                   minutes.</li>

            <li>While the soup is simmering, cut four 1-inch-thick
                 slices from baguette; reserve the remaining bread
                  for serving. Toast baguette slices in the
                   preheated oven just until browned, about 10 
                   minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. 
                    Increase the oven temperature to 425 degrees F 
                   (220 degrees C).</li>

            <li>Ladle soup into four 12-ounce, oven-safe bowls.
                 Place one slice toasted baguette on top of the 
                 soup in each bowl. Fold Swiss cheese slices, and 
                 fit onto toasted bread slices. Place soup bowls
                  onto a cookie sheet for easier handling.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until cheese is melted,
                 about 10 minutes.</li>

        </ol>
